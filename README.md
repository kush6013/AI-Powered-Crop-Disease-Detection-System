# AI-Powered-Crop-Disease-Detection-System
we aim to create a proof-of-concept AI model that can detect common crop diseases by analyzing images of leaves. Our primary goal is to design and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify whether a crop is healthy or diseased and, if diseased, specify the type of disease along with basic treatment
